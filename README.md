# Precision_Guitar_Tuner
# 🎸 STM32 Guitar Tuner (FFT-Based)

An **embedded guitar tuner** project built using **STM32F446xx**, **ADC sampling**, and **CMSIS-DSP FFT** to detect guitar string frequencies in real time.  
It samples analog audio from a microphone or pickup, performs a **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to find the fundamental frequency, and displays the **closest note** and tuning direction on an **LCD**.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time audio sampling using **ADC + Timer Trigger**  
✅ **Hanning Windowing** for smooth FFT performance  
✅ Frequency detection using **CMSIS DSP’s `arm_rfft_fast_f32()`**  
✅ LCD Display shows:
- Detected frequency  
- Closest standard guitar note  
- Whether the string is **High / Low / In Tune**  
✅ User button (PC13) starts each measurement  
✅ Optional **test sine-wave generator** for simulation (no hardware required)

## 🔍 FFT Processing Logic

1. **Apply Hanning Window:**  
   Smooths discontinuities at the edges of the sample buffer.
   ```c
   windowed_buffer[i] = adc_buffer[i] * (0.5f - 0.5f * cosf(2 * PI * i / (BUFFER_SIZE - 1)));


2. **Perform FFT**
   arm_rfft_fast_init_f32(&fft_inst, BUFFER_SIZE);
   arm_rfft_fast_f32(&fft_inst, windowed_buffer, fft_real, 0);


3. **Find Peak Magnitude**
   The bin with maximum magnitude corresponds to the dominant frequency.
   
4. **Calculate frequency:**
   detected_freq = peak_index * (SAMPLING_RATE / BUFFER_SIZE);

5. **Compare with Guitar Notes:**
   Finds the closest frequency and determines if the string is HIGH, LOW, or IN TUNE.



## 🧰 Development Setup
**🪛 Requirements**

STM32F446xx board (e.g., Nucleo-F446RE)

STM32CubeIDE or Keil uVision

CMSIS-DSP library (included with STM32CubeIDE)

LCD library (lcd.h, lcd.c)

arm_math.h (from CMSIS-DSP)

Guitar(electric) (0-3.3 V signal range)

Analog Front end circuit consisting of a 4th order Butterworth LPF, and a Level shifter circuit to obtain 0V-3.3V operation.



**⚡ How It Works**

On button press (PC13), an EXTI interrupt sets a flag.

The main loop starts ADC sampling (Timer2-triggered or software).

1024 samples are collected at 8 kHz rate.

FFT is applied to determine the dominant frequency.

The closest note and tuning status are shown on the LCD.


**📟 Example LCD Output**
Note: A2  F:110Hz
Diff:+0.4Hz HIGH

**🧪 Debug Mode (Software Test)**

You can test the FFT without hardware by generating a sine wave:

*fill_adc_buffer_with_sine(246.94f, 0.5f, 8000.0f); // Simulate B3*
*process_buffer();*

**🔧 Future Improvements**

-Add DMA-based ADC sampling
-Implement auto-gain / signal detection
-Show real-time frequency bar or needle
-Support for other instruments
